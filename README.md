App Feature implementations:
    Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
    UI contains settings menu to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.
    UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.
    Movie Details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.

User Interface - Functions
    When a user changes the sort criteria (most popular, highest rated, and favorites) the main view gets updated correctly.
    When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched [Phone] or displayed in a fragment [Tablet].
    When a trailer is selected, app uses an Intent to launch the trailer.
    In the movies detail screen, a user can tap a button(a star) to mark it as a Favorite.
Network API Implementation
    In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
    App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
    App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
